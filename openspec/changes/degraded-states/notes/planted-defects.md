# Planted defects

Each entry: the gate, the plant, the red output, and confirmation the plant was reverted
(`git diff --name-only` / `git status --porcelain` afterwards, or a direct `diff` against the
pre-plant backup).

## Group 2 — `scripts/gates/wired.sh`

**Plant 1 (leg 2 negative control, task 2.5):** reinstated the `match` in `pub fn run()`:

```rust
let cwd = match startup_cwd(&crate::config::env_lookup()) {
    Some(cwd) => cwd,
    None => std::env::current_dir()?,
};
```

Red:

```
WIRED FAIL (leg 2): 'pub fn run()' holds a branch or a loop:
5:    let cwd = match startup_cwd(&crate::config::env_lookup()) {
everything with a decision in it belongs in run_wired, which is tested
```

Reverted; `sh scripts/gates/wired.sh` green afterwards.

**Plant 2 (leg 5b negative control, task 2.6):** deleted the `startup_dir(` call and inlined
`std::env::current_dir()?` directly (no branch, no loop — leg 2 alone would pass):

```rust
let cwd = std::env::current_dir()?;
```

Red:

```
WIRED FAIL: leg 5b: 'pub fn run()' does not name startup_dir( - the cwd-resolution decision may have been reinlined
```

Reverted; `diff` against the pre-plant backup of `src/ui/mod.rs` reports no difference.
